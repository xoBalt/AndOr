Welcome to the Andor Assembly Language Programming Contest!


# Rules
We’re on “the honor system here”. Obviously, there’s no way for the judges to know if you’re stacking the deck with a team of 20 people, farming the problems out to a programmer overseas, or any of that. The point is to have some fun, see how well you can do, and have some fun. Oh, there’s cool T-Shirts too.

1. There will be up to 20 teams.
2. A team is up to four individuals.
3. For this contest, although it may change in the future, a university can have only one team. We are trying to test out the contest and would like a broad audience. If we don’t end up with 20 universities we may have some flexibility here.
4. The contest is three days long and there are ten problems every day.
**a.** Problems start at the same value, so it is worth your time to read through all of them and look for any that might appear simpler.
**b.** We do not expect a team to solve all of the problems, of
course. So again, pick and choose wisely.
**c.** The first team to solve a particular problem receives 100 points. The second team receives 95, the third receives 90, and so on.
**d.** The scoreboard web site will show how many teams have submitted a problem as well as how many have solved it. More on this below.

5. Each day at 9:00 CST a ZIP file containing the problems for that day will be posted to the “#general” channel on the slack contest site.

6. Your team will un-zip the problems and get to work!
7. The contest is over at 5:00 PM CST on each day. But no problems for a particular day will be accepted after a 4:00 PM CST problem deadline. This will allow judging to continue if things get backed up.

8. If there is a problem with a particular element of the contest (e.g. a confusing instruction in a document) the judges will at their discretion post clarification in the “#general” channel.
9. If a team wishes to ask a particular / private question of the judges post these in the “Direct Messages” on Slack. There will be one of these per team. 10. When a team solves a problem:
**a.** The team uploads their “.s” source code file on the “Direct Message” area on Slack. Obviously you will want to be careful not to upload it on “#general”!
**b.** The assignment of points is not immediate. The judges will examine
the program and first consider:
i. Is it actually written from scratch and not the product of a compiler?
ii. Does it have appropriate documentation in the form of comments?
**c.** The judges will test the program with input values that are different than the ones listed in the problem description. It is important that you realize this and make sure your
program handles data in general, not just the examples in
the problem statement!
**d.** If the program passes muster the judges will:
i. Post an announcement, e.g. “The NULLify team has
solved Problem 6 – calculating all digits of pi”.
ii. Assign the appropriate points to the team.
iii. The scoring web site will be updated at that time.

11. If the judges determine that a problem is not correct they will
provide details back to the team. This does not count against
the team, although sending obviously half-baked programs in
order to get feedback is frowned upon.

12. If the judges are frowning too much from the previous rule they have the right to take points away from a team.

13. There is no rule number 13.
